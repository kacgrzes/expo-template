# Monorepo

This template for a monorepo helps in easy development in multiple projects within a single repository. It takes full advantage of Expo for building React Native applications, Bun for fast JavaScript runtime, Biome for code linting and formatting, TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript, Husky for Git hooks, and Turborepo to run and build the monorepo with good efficiency.

This is still WIP so wait for the final version to be released.
